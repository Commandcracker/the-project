# Hello and welcome to this project

## Project Objectives

### Objective 1

The first objective of this project is to develop [CC: T](https://tweaked.cc/) [lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html) [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) for all [selected algorithms in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Post-Quantum_Cryptography_Standardization#Selected_Algorithms_2022).

All libaries should be as modular as possible and they should pass lints by [selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene) and [illuaminate](https://github.com/SquidDev/illuaminate). The libries should support being used by [require](https://tweaked.cc/library/cc.require.html) and by [dofile](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-dofile). All libraries should be documented using the [Ldoc](https://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/) syntax.

### Objective 2

The second objective is to develop a secure networking framework using those post-quantum algorithms. The networking framework should support replacing [rednet](https://tweaked.cc/module/rednet.html) by providing almost 1:1 functionality.

## License for the Project

Everything should be kept open source, and the license will be discussed among contributors after the completion of all objectives.
